- Cross-platform support (macOS, Windows, Linux)

## Installation

### macOS (Homebrew)

You can install AI Terminal using Homebrew:

brew tap AiTerminalFoundation/ai-terminal
brew install ai-terminal
```

After installation, you can launch the application from Spotlight or run it from the terminal:

```bash

```

### Requirements

- For AI features: [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) (can be installed with `brew install ollama`)

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Rust and Cargo
- Tauri CLI

### macOS Universal Binary

To build a universal binary for macOS (arm64 + x86_64):

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install create-dmg tool for packaging
brew install create-dmg

# Run the build script
chmod +x build-macos.sh
./build-macos.sh
```

This will create a universal binary DMG installer at `src-tauri/target/universal-apple-darwin/bundle/dmg/ai-terminal-[version].dmg`.
